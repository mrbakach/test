# Install Build Task

During the section we'll install `build` task, which compiles the code and pushes the image to local registry.

The build task uses [buildah] to build and push the image to the registry.

[buildah]: https://buildah.io/

### Requirements

Before starting make sure you have the following:

* [Kubernetes](1.install-kubernetes.md): kubernetes cluster up and running.
* [Tekton](2.install-tekton.md): tekton installed.
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (optional): Go installed if you want to build the app locally.
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (optional): Docker installed if you want to build the app locally in a container image.
* [tkn](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli): A CLI for interacting with Tekton.

### Steps

Apply the following tekton task and resources:

```sh
# build task
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f tekton/2.tasks/build-task.yaml
task.tekton.dev/build created

# tekton-tutorial git & image pipeline-resources
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f tekton/1.resources/
pipelineresource.tekton.dev/tekton-tutorial-git created
pipelineresource.tekton.dev/tekton-tutorial-image created
```

List the installed tekton tasks and resources:

```sh
‚ùØ tkn task list
NAME    DESCRIPTION        AGE
build   build & push app   3 seconds ago

‚ùØ tkn resource list
NAME                    TYPE    DETAILS
tekton-tutorial-git     git     url: https://github.com/harbur/tekton-tutorial
tekton-tutorial-image   image   url: example.com/harbur/tekton-tutorial
```

> PipelineResources in a pipeline are the set of objects that are going to be used as inputs to a Task and can be output by a Task.

### Verify

There is a lot to unpack here. We'll go step-by-step and explain first how to run the code locally using `go` in your machine, then compile it inside an docker image and run it as a container, and lastly we'll create some pipeline resources to represent this git repository as a registry image and trigger the build task to compile the image and push it to the local registry.

Each of the steps below are independent between each other, so if you're confortable you can skip (a) or (b) of the following steps. Step (c) is necessary to be run at least once so that a built image is ready to be deployed on next stage.

* (a) Run Go app
* (b) Run Docker image
* (c) Run Build task

***(a) Run Go app***

Before running the `build` task, let's try to build and run the code locally first.

To run the code execute and leave it running:

```go
go run main.go
```

The app is now listening to port `:8080` so let's test it using curl on a separate console:

```sh
‚ùØ curl localhost:8080/there
Hello
```

***(b) Run Docker image***

To build the docker image run:

```sh
‚ùØ docker build -t tekton-tutorial .

```

Run the container and test it with `curl` on port `8080`:

```sh
# Run tekton-tutorial
‚ùØ docker run --name tekton-tutorial -dp 8080:8080 tekton-tutorial
8abc5b4fb9a5c86c4e0e225317977cac424699cdb3133c098e3cc32936a550bc

# test it
‚ùØ curl localhost:8080/there
Hello

# tear-down
‚ùØ docker rm -f tekton-tutorial
```

> Note that the Dockerfile is using multistage build so that the final image doesn't include the source code and build tools (more specifically it uses empty scratch base image since go can be statically built).

***(c) Run Build task***

Let's start the build task:

```sh
‚ùØ tkn task start build
? Choose the git resource to use for source: tekton-tutorial-git (https://github.com/harbur/tekton-tutorial#main)
? Choose the image resource to use for builtImage: tekton-tutorial-image (example.com/harbur/tekton-tutorial)
? Value for param `contextDir` of type `string`? (Default is `.`) .
? Value for param `destinationImage` of type `string`? (Default is `$(outputs.resources.builtImage.url)`) $(outputs.resources.builtImage.url)
? Value for param `dockerFile` of type `string`? (Default is `Dockerfile`) Dockerfile
? Value for param `tlsVerify` of type `string`? (Default is `false`) false
TaskRun started: build-run-55rvb

In order to track the TaskRun progress run:
tkn taskrun logs build-run-55rvb -f -n default
```

It prompts you to choose parameter values, continue with the defaults and wait for the pod to start (First run may take a minute or so to download the image):

```sh
‚ùØ kubectl get pod -w
NAME                        READY   STATUS            RESTARTS   AGE
build-run-55rvb-pod-hptkw   0/5     PodInitializing   0          51s
```

Check the logs of the TaskRun to see the progress of the compilation:

```sh
‚ùØ tkn taskrun logs -L -f

### Tear Down

If you want to tear down the build task:

```sh
# Delete tekton pipelineresources
kubectl delete -f tekton/1.resources/

# Delete tekton build task
kubectl delete -f tekton/2.tasks/build-task.yaml
```
