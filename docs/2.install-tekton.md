# Install Tekton

During the section we'll install [tekton pipelines] & [tekton triggers] to the cluster.

* Tekton Pipelines project provides k8s-style resources for declaring CI/CD-style pipelines.
* Tekton Triggers project allows you to extract information from events payloads (a "trigger") to create Kubernetes resources.

This tutorial was tested with tekton-pipeline `v0.20.1` and tekton-releases `v0.11.1`. The installation steps are pinned with those versions.

### Steps

```sh
# install tekton pipeline
kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.20.1/release.yaml

# install tekton releases
kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/previous/v0.11.1/release.yaml
